## Function: makeCacheMatrix(x)
## makeCacheMatrix takes as input a matrix, 'x', and output a set of functions
## for caching the results of the computation of the inverse of the matrix.
## By default the function will create an empty matrix when no other input is given.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Function: cacheSolve(x, ...)
## cacheSolve takes as input a matrix, 'x', with other arguments and outputs the
## inverse of the matrix 'x'

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
